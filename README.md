## <a id="overview"></a>📖 Overview

This configuration is built with a dual focus on **modular isolation** and **Standalone Workspace Architecture**. While core system features (Hardware, Docker, Cooling) are contained within independent NixOS modules, user environments (dotfiles, terminal, tools) are fully isolated and provisioned automatically using **Home Manager**.

**Key Technical Pillars:**
* ⚙️ **System Modularity:** Every system component is an independent module. If you don't need a feature, you can disable it by simply removing one line. This ensures your system remains lightweight and contains only the tools you actually use.
* 📦 **Zero-Touch Provisioning:** When a new user opens their terminal for the first time, their personal `home.nix` workspace is automatically compiled and activated.
* 🛠️ **Pro Developer Tooling:** Isolated Zsh environments, Kitty terminal, automated PostgreSQL database kits, and safe custom shortcut bindings.
* 🌡️ **Integrated Hardware Control:** Custom fan control scripts (NBFC) tied to GNOME shortcuts and top-bar monitoring.

---

## <a id="architecture"></a>🏗️ Architecture

The `configuration.nix` acts as the central hub. It defines system-level imports and declares the user profiles.

* **`/modules/`**: System-wide capabilities (Docker, VirtualBox, Cooling, Monitoring).
* **`/templates/`**: Project-specific `nix-shell` environments (Java, Minecraft, PostgreSQL).
* **`/users/layouts/`**: Base profile definitions (e.g., `all-Feature` or `simple`).
* **`/users/features/`**: Granular, plug-and-play user app modules (e.g., `kathara.nix`).

When a user is created, an **Activation Script** assigns them a layout (e.g., `all-Feature` or `simple`) and generates a standalone `home-manager` template in their personal directory, which they can then edit freely.

---

## <a id="installation"></a>⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. 📥 Get the Configuration

1. **Enter a temporary shell with Git** (required if Git is not yet installed on your system):
   ```bash
   nix-shell -p git
   ```
   
2. **Backup your hardware profile** (vital for your specific machine):
   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix /tmp/
   ```
3. **Clone the repository** (this will empty the directory first):
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /etc/nixos/*
   sudo git clone https://github.com/Tot0le/NixOS_config.git /etc/nixos
   ```
4. **Restore your hardware profile**:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /tmp/hardware-configuration.nix /etc/nixos/
   ```

### 2. 👤 Provisioning Users (CRITICAL)

**Before building**, you MUST edit the configuration to set your actual username:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```
Update the `usersConfigs` attribute set at the top with your credentials:
```nix
  usersConfigs = {
    yourname = { fullName = "Your Name"; isAdmin = true; layout = "all-Feature"; };
  };
```

### 3. 🔨 Build the System
Apply the global configuration:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

### 4. 🚀 Auto-Initialization & Permissions

1. **Fix Git Permissions**: Claim ownership of the configuration folder so your local shell can read it properly without root access. Replace `yourname` with your actual username:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R yourname:users /etc/nixos
   ```
2. **Initialize Workspace**: Open a **NEW** terminal window. The system will automatically detect your uninitialized workspace, install Home Manager, and apply your layout. (If an error occurs, the script will warn you and stop, allowing you to fix it and try in a new terminal).

### 5. 🔄 Future Updates
For future modifications to your user-specific configuration (dotfiles, terminal, shortcuts), you don't need root privileges anymore. Simply run:

```bash
home-manager switch
```

## <a id="tools"></a>🧰 Development Tools

### 🌐 Network Emulation (kathará)
A fully configured network emulation environment utilizing Docker. It is modularized within features/kathara.nix and natively defaults to xterm to ensure robust rendering of virtual device consoles without Wayland/OpenGL conflicts.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL Kit (`postgres-kit`)
This configuration includes a template for an isolated PostgreSQL development environment. It allows you to run a local database server within your project folder without affecting the global system.

1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Run `setup-db`. This copies the template locally and opens it in `nano` for any specific edits.
3. Upon closing the editor, the Nix shell environment launches automatically.
4. Start the server with `pg_ctl start -l logfile`. VSCodium is pre-configured with the "Database Client" extension to connect.
5. Exit the shell with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>; a `trap` will automatically shut down the database server.

### ☕ Java & Minecraft Kits
Use `setup-java` (JDK 21, JavaFX, Maven) or `setup-minecraft` (JDK 25, Playit.gg) to instantly deploy isolated project environments with proper library pathing for graphical interfaces.

### 🔑 Local Git Token Manager
A secure, per-user script to copy your GitHub token to the Wayland clipboard:
1. Run `copyGitToken`. On the first run, it will interactively prompt you to store your token and create a local access PIN.
2. Credentials are automatically locked down (`chmod 600`) in `~/.config/`.
3. Subsequent runs will only require your PIN to copy the token and trigger a GNOME notification.

## <a id="shortcuts"></a>⌨️ Custom Workflow & Shortcuts

Shortcuts are centrally configured in `conf/shortcuts.list.nix` and bridged dynamically to GNOME via a custom Python sync script.

| Feature | Keybinding |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Kitty Terminal** | <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> |
| **Firefox Browser** | <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> |
| **Nautilus Explorer** | <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> |
| **Color Picker** | <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>ù</kbd> |
| **Fan Control** | <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>F1-F7</kbd> |

### 📊 Hardware Monitoring
Integrated fan control via <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>F1-F7</kbd> and real-time status updates in the Gnome Top Bar using custom Argos scripts.

## <a id="theming"></a>🎨 Desktop & Theming

The environment uses the **Catppuccin** aesthetic across the system, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing experience.

### 🌗 Dynamic Theme Sync
GNOME and the Kitty terminal are fully synchronized. Changing the GNOME color scheme (Dark/Light mode) will automatically trigger a background service (`kitty-theme-sync`) to switch Kitty between **Catppuccin Mocha** (Dark) and **Catppuccin Latte** (Light).
- Manually switch terminal themes with: `switch_theme [mocha|macchiato|frappe|latte]`
- Toggle terminal opacity with: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> / <kbd>P</kbd>

### 🖼️ Wallpaper Management
Your desktop background is managed declaratively. To change it, open your `home.nix` and update the `my.gnome.wallpaper` variable to point to your new image file.
* **GNOME Cache Warning:** If you replace the image file but keep the *exact same filename* (e.g., `wallpaper.jpg`), GNOME will not update the background immediately due to memory caching. Always use a new filename or log out and back in to force the refresh.
* *(Note: A detailed quick-start tutorial is automatically generated in your `Pictures` folder upon your first login).*

### 🛠️ Customizing Your Setup
**Recommendation:** For the best experience, start by assigning yourself the `all-Feature` layout in `configuration.nix`. Once your `home.nix` is generated in your personal directory, simply open it and remove the imports or features you don't need. This is much faster and cleaner than building a layout from scratch!

### 🚑 Troubleshooting Themes
If your GNOME themes or icons ever get stuck due to manual tweaking in the interface, use these fallback commands to reset them to default before running a system rebuild:

    gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme
    gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme
